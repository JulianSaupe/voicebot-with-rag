## Components

### SpeechBubble.svelte
The main visual centerpiece featuring:
- Dynamic scaling based on audio levels
- Animated sound waves that respond to audio intensity
- Floating particles around the bubble when active
- Different visual states (inactive, active, listening)
- Smooth glow effects and pulsing animations

### ToggleSwitch.svelte
A custom toggle component with:
- Smooth thumb animation
- Glowing effects when enabled
- Icons to indicate on/off states
- Hover and focus states
- Fully accessible with ARIA labels

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm

### Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173`

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

## Customization

### Colors
The main color scheme uses cyan/teal colors. To customize:
- Primary: `#40e0d0` (turquoise)
- Secondary: `#00bcd4` (cyan) 
- Accent: `#0097a7` (dark cyan)

### Audio Integration
Currently uses mock audio levels for demonstration. To integrate with real audio:

1. Replace the `audioLevel` simulation in `+page.svelte`
2. Connect to your audio processing pipeline

### Speech Bubble Behavior
Customize the speech bubble animation by modifying:
- `bubbleScale`: Controls size changes (based on audio level)
- `glowIntensity`: Controls glow effect intensity
- `pulseSpeed`: Controls animation speed
